 *
 * In this game, you're an adventurer lost in a mysterious manor. 
 * A riddler knight appears, offering guidance but with a twist â€“ 
 * you must solve his riddles to get hints for the final question. 
 * Answer it right to stay healthy and escape; otherwise, you lose 
 * health and the chance to break free. Watch out for lurking enemies! 
 * Beat the challenges, and you'll move on to the next stage, getting 
 * closer to leaving the manor.
